# Purpose
I often play "Words with Friends" with my parents and siblings, all of which live far away. So, to us, it's a way to keep in touch. We chat a lot, sometimes about game play, and other times about life. I found myself hesitating to chat much though, not knowing how to retrieve the chats and store them somewhere less proprietary. So I developed this way of capturing WWF chats.
